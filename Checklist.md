# Merge Request Checklist for API Automation

This checklist is for all Merge Requests (MRs) related to API automation changes. Please ensure all applicable items are addressed before submitting the MR.

## General API Automation Checks:

* [ ] Does the automation fulfill the intended testâ€™s purpose?
* [ ] Are the tests robust and reliable (not flaky)?
* [ ] Are the tests easy to understand and maintain?
* [ ] Are the tests following the project's automation style guide and best practices?
* [ ] Are the tests documented appropriately (clear descriptions, comments)?
* [ ] Are the test data managed effectively?
* [ ] Are any new dependencies required for the automation? If so, are they approved and documented?
* [ ] Have you run the automation locally and confirmed it passes?

## Specific API Checks:

### Contract Validation:

* [ ] Are different response codes tested?

### Request Validation:

* [ ] Are request parameters validated?
* [ ] Are request headers validated?
* [ ] Are request bodies validated (format, data types)?

### HTTP Methods:

* [ ] Are all relevant HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.) tested?

### Authentication and Authorization:

* [ ] Is authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth, JWT) handled correctly in the tests?
* [ ] Is authorization (access control) tested (e.g., different roles/permissions)?

### Error Handling:

* [ ] Are error responses validated (status codes, error messages, error schemas)?
* [ ] Are specific error scenarios tested (e.g., invalid input, missing data, server errors)?

### Data Driven Testing:

* [ ] Are data-driven testing techniques used where appropriate (e.g., parameterization, external data sources)?
* [ ] Are different data sets used to test various scenarios?

### Mocking/Stubbing:

* [ ] Are mocks or stubs used effectively for external dependencies or unavailable services?
* [ ] Are mock/stub responses realistic and cover different scenarios?

### Assertions:


* [ ] Are clear and specific assertions used to validate responses (status codes, headers, body content)?
* [ ] Are all relevant fields in the response validated?

## Code Quality and Review:

* [ ] Has the automation code been reviewed by another team member?
* [ ] Does the code adhere to the project's coding standards?
* [ ] Is the code clean, well-structured, and easy to understand?

## Documentation:

* [ ] Is the automation approach documented (e.g., in a README)?
* [ ] Are the test cases clearly described and linked to requirements/user stories?
